                <div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>In 2010, back in the early days of smartphones, a friend and I decided to create a different type of mobile game from what was currently available. Sushi Loco is a project we worked on from the ground up to make a side-scrolling platform game that uses the accelerometer.</p>
<h3 id="itsopensource">It's Open Source</h3>
<p>And now, I'm excited to have my largest personal project written released as <a href="#">open source code on Github</a>. You can also <a href="#">watch it on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>If you aren't inclined yet, are you here looking for a way to make a Katamari Damacy clone? Are you curious to see how linear impulses affect a circle shaped body in a Box2D physics world? Perhaps I've written similar features to things you've written and you'd like to see what conclusions I've made. Learn from this code base as I have from open source code.</p>

<p>My friend and I didn't have many options to create a quick mobile game for Android. We both had Android phones with an accelerometer, something that was a desired feature then, and that made our hardware specific enough to begin with. We easily ruled out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_software_development#Android_NDK">Android NDK</a> because we didn't have an existing C++ code base to port. More so, the debugging and build tools were absolutely minimal or non-existent. We couldn't work with blindfolds on! Eventually we well understood that Java was the only way forward. This is why Sushi Loco is written with <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGDX</a>. There simply was no other framework at the time that was fast, worked with native platform tools, and had a strong community presence with active developers. Times have changed and so have the tools. If I were to make a new project today I'd pick LibGDX, Unity, and Unreal as a starting point and then evaluate for my needs. Even the Android NDK is a solid option for an existing code base in C++.</p>
